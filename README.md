# COMP6841 Something Awsome Project
By HasmH  
This repository is used to store and track progress for my COMP6841(Extended Security Engineering and Cyber Security) course project - where I will be creating a type of malware that is diguised as a simple video game using primarily Python3.  
The malware's objective is to keylog the victim, as well as steal their browser cookie data, and exfiltrate this information over a network via email. Once the executable is stopped, it will plant a persistent background process that will continue to keylog the victim (and steal their cookie data every X hours..).
